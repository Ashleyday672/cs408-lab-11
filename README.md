# Lab 11.2 

## Overview

In this project we made a simple GUI interface that connects with AWS to hold objects. To run and interact clone this repo into an IDE that supports live preview. You will then be able to add, remove, and get all the items on the server. This works if multiple instances are being used at the same time.
